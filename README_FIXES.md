## 🚀 How It Works Now

### Quiz Generation Flow
```
1. User clicks "Generate Quiz"
2. Browser validates API key exists
3. Creates detailed prompt with:
   - Learning style guidelines
   - Field context
   - Format requirements
4. Calls openRouterService.askAboutContent()
5. Service handles:
   - Retry logic
   - Fallback models
   - Caching
   - Rate limiting
6. Response parsed into Question objects
7. 5 questions displayed to user
```

### Payment Checkout Flow
```
1. User clicks "Subscribe"
2. Client detects environment (local/production)
3. Calls `/.netlify/functions/yoco/checkout`
4. Function receives request:
   - Validates required fields
   - Calls Yoco API
   - Returns checkout session
5. User redirected to payment page
6. Handles success/failure/cancel URLs
```
