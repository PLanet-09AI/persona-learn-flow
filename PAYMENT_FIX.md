# Payment Service Fix - Yoco Checkout Configuration

## Problem
The Yoco checkout endpoint was returning 404 errors because:
1. Client was calling `/.netlify/functions/yoco/checkout`
2. The function didn't exist in the proper file structure
3. The function was incorrectly named `payment-service.ts` instead of being in the `yoco/` directory

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Proper Function Structure
```
netlify/functions/
├── yoco/
│   └── checkout.ts          ← New Yoco checkout function
├── ai-service.ts
├── openrouter-service.ts
└── payment-service.ts
```

### 2. Updated netlify.toml Configuration
Added configuration for the new Yoco function:
```toml
[functions."yoco/checkout"]
  included_files = ["netlify/functions/**/*"]
  environment = { YOCO_SECRET_KEY = "sk_test_443a9ffcR4ArAmZ7e144502b4b1a" }
```

### 3. Fixed Client-Side API Endpoint
Updated `src/services/yocoEnhanced.ts` to properly handle local and production environments:
- Uses `/.netlify/functions/yoco/checkout` for both local and production
- Detects environment correctly
- Passes checkout request with proper headers

### 4. Function Details
The Yoco checkout function (`netlify/functions/yoco/checkout.ts`):
- Accepts POST requests only
- Validates required fields (amount, cancelUrl, successUrl)
- Calls Yoco API with proper authentication
- Returns checkout session data
- Handles errors gracefully

## How It Works

### Request Flow
1. User initiates payment → `yocoEnhanced.ts`
2. Client calls `/.netlify/functions/yoco/checkout`
3. Netlify redirects to `netlify/functions/yoco/checkout.ts`
4. Function calls Yoco API with `YOCO_SECRET_KEY`
5. Response returned to client

### Environment Variables Required
- `YOCO_SECRET_KEY`: Yoco API secret key (set in Netlify environment)

## Testing Payment
1. Click "Subscribe" button
2. Payment form should appear (no 404 error)
3. Test transaction will process with Yoco

## Deployment
When you push to production, Netlify will:
1. Build the project with `npm run build`
2. Deploy the function at `/.netlify/functions/yoco/checkout`
3. Make it available at the configured URL

## Rollback If Needed
If issues occur, the old `payment-service.ts` is still available as a reference.
