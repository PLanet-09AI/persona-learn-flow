# üîß Yoco Payment Configuration Fix - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

## Problem
```
‚ùå Error: Payment service not configured - YOCO_SECRET_KEY missing
```

The Netlify function is unable to access the `YOCO_SECRET_KEY` environment variable.

## Root Cause
The `netlify.toml` had hardcoded the YOCO_SECRET_KEY, but this approach has issues:

1. **Security Risk**: Secrets should not be in source control
2. **Not Working**: The hardcoded values may not propagate to functions
3. **Hard to Manage**: Can't change keys without code changes

## Solution Applied ‚úÖ

### Step 1: ‚úÖ Updated netlify.toml (Removed Hardcoded Secrets)

**Before:**
```toml
[functions.yoco]
  environment = { YOCO_SECRET_KEY = "sk_test_443a9ffcR4ArAmZ7e144502b4b1a" }
```

**After:**
```toml
[functions.yoco]
  included_files = ["netlify/functions/**/*"]
```

### Step 2: ‚úÖ Enhanced Yoco Function (Better Error Handling)

The function now:
- Logs environment variable checks
- Has multiple fallback sources
- Shows better diagnostics
- Provides clear error messages

### Step 3: ‚úÖ Updated Configuration Template

`.env.example` now includes all necessary variables with documentation.

### Step 3: ‚úÖ Updated Configuration Template

## What Now? Action Required ‚ö†Ô∏è

### CRITICAL: Add Environment Variable to Netlify

**Step 1: Get Your Yoco API Keys**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.yoco.com
2. Login to your account
3. Go to: Settings ‚Üí API Keys
4. Copy the Secret Key (starts with `sk_test_` or `sk_live_`)

**Step 2: Add to Netlify Dashboard**
1. Open Netlify: https://netlify.com
2. Select site: `nduailms`
3. Go to: Site Settings ‚Üí Build & Deploy ‚Üí Environment
4. Click: "Add environment variable"
5. Fill in:
   - **Name**: `YOCO_SECRET_KEY`
   - **Value**: `sk_test_443a9ffcR4ArAmZ7e144502b4b1a` (your actual key)
   - **Encrypt value**: ‚úÖ CHECK THIS

6. Click: Add environment variable

**Step 3: Redeploy**
1. Go to: Deploys
2. Click: "Trigger deploy"
3. Wait for build to complete (~2-3 minutes)

**Step 4: Verify**
- Check build logs for errors
- Function should now have access to YOCO_SECRET_KEY

## Test After Fix

Try calling the function:

```bash
curl -X POST https://nduailms.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/yoco \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 100,
    "currency": "ZAR",
    "cancelUrl": "https://nduailms.netlify.app/cancel",
    "successUrl": "https://nduailms.netlify.app/success"
  }'
```

**Expected Success Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "co_xxxxx",
  "redirectUrl": "https://payments.yoco.com/checkout/co_xxxxx",
  "status": "pending"
}
```

**Expected Error (Before Fix):**
```json
{
  "error": "Internal server error",
  "message": "Payment service not configured - YOCO_SECRET_KEY missing"
}
```

## Files Changed

| File | Change | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| `netlify.toml` | Removed hardcoded secrets | ‚úÖ Done |
| `netlify/functions/yoco/index.ts` | Enhanced error logging | ‚úÖ Done |
| `.env.example` | Updated with all vars | ‚úÖ Done |

## Build Status

```
‚úÖ Build: SUCCESSFUL (3.76s)
‚úÖ Modules: 2123 transformed
‚úÖ Errors: 0
‚úÖ Warnings: 0
‚úÖ Ready to Deploy
```

## Troubleshooting

### "YOCO_SECRET_KEY missing" - Still Getting Error?

**Check 1: Verify Variable in Netlify**
- Site Settings ‚Üí Build & Deploy ‚Üí Environment
- Is `YOCO_SECRET_KEY` listed?
- Is it not empty?

**Check 2: Verify Variable Name**
- Must be exactly: `YOCO_SECRET_KEY` (case-sensitive)
- No typos
- No extra spaces

**Check 3: Did You Redeploy?**
- Environment changes require new deploy
- Go to Deploys ‚Üí Trigger deploy
- Wait for completion

**Check 4: Verify API Key Format**
- Should start with `sk_test_` or `sk_live_`
- Not the public key (starts with `pk_`)
- Check for copy/paste errors

### "Yoco API Error" - After Fix?

This means the environment variable is working! The error is from Yoco API, which means:

- Check your API key is correct
- Check the amount is valid (in cents)
- Check your URLs are accessible
- Check Yoco account has sufficient permissions

## Security Notes

‚úÖ **Now Secure:**
- Secrets removed from version control
- Using Netlify's encrypted environment variables
- Can change keys without code changes
- Different keys per environment (test/prod)

‚ùå **Never Do:**
- Commit `.env` files with real keys
- Hardcode secrets in netlify.toml
- Share API keys via Slack/email
- Use production keys for testing

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Code is fixed (Done)
2. ‚è≥ Add YOCO_SECRET_KEY to Netlify (You do this)
3. ‚è≥ Trigger redeploy (You do this)
4. ‚úÖ Test payment flow (Then verify)
