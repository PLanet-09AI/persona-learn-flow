# ‚úÖ FINAL DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

## Pre-Deployment Verification

### Code Quality
- [x] Build succeeds: `npm run build`
- [x] No TypeScript errors
- [x] No console errors locally
- [x] All functions created

### Files Verification
- [x] `netlify/functions/yoco/index.ts` exists
- [x] `netlify/functions/yoco/checkout.ts` exists  
- [x] `src/services/yocoEnhanced.ts` updated
- [x] `netlify.toml` updated with yoco config
- [x] Redirects added

### Local Testing
- [ ] Start `npm run dev`
- [ ] Test quiz generation (should work)
- [ ] Test payment checkout (may return 404 locally - EXPECTED)
- [ ] Check console for proper logs

---

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Verify Everything is Committed
```bash
git status
# Should show clean working directory
```

### Step 2: Build Production
```bash
npm run build
# Should complete successfully
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Netlify
```bash
npm run netlify:deploy
# Or manually:
netlify deploy --prod
```

### Step 4: Verify Deployment
```
Expected: "Deploy is live"
Site: https://nduailms.netlify.app
```

---

## Post-Deployment Testing

### Immediately After Deploy (5-10 minutes)
1. **Clear browser cache**
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete
   - Clear all cached files

2. **Test on production site**
   - Go to https://nduailms.netlify.app
   - Log in if needed
   - Navigate to learning page

3. **Test payment flow**
   - Click "Subscribe"
   - Check Network tab (F12) for requests
   - Verify `/.netlify/functions/yoco` returns 200
   - Verify payment form loads

4. **Check console logs**
   - Open F12
   - Look for "üîê Yoco checkout function called"
   - Look for "‚úÖ Checkout created successfully"

### Expected Behavior After Fix
‚úÖ Subscribe button works
‚úÖ No 404 error in Network tab
‚úÖ Payment form appears
‚úÖ Yoco checkout session is created
‚úÖ User redirected to payment page

---

## If 404 Still Occurs

### Immediate Actions
1. **Check function deployment**
   - Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Functions
   - Should see "yoco" function listed
   - Check function logs for errors

2. **Verify environment variables**
   - Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Build & Deploy
   - Verify `YOCO_SECRET_KEY` is set
   - Trigger manual redeploy

3. **Check netlify.toml**
   - Ensure yoco function is configured correctly
   - Ensure redirects are in place
   - Force redeploy

### Debug Steps
```bash
# View deployment logs
netlify status

# View specific function logs
netlify functions:invoke yoco

# Check build output
netlify build --verbose
```

---

## Success Indicators

### Network Tab Shows
- POST to `/.netlify/functions/yoco`
- Status: **200** (not 404)
- Response contains checkout session data

### Console Shows
```
üîê Yoco checkout function called
‚úÖ API key found: sk_test_...
Calling Yoco API...
‚úÖ Checkout created successfully: [ID]
```

### User Experience
1. Click Subscribe
2. Payment form appears instantly
3. Can enter card details
4. Payment processes normally

---

## Troubleshooting Matrix

| Issue | Check | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| 404 error | Function in Netlify | Redeploy |
| Function logs empty | Build succeeded | Check logs |
| Wrong API key | Env variables | Update in Netlify |
| Slow response | API status | Check Yoco status |
| Payment form doesn't load | CORS headers | Verify redirects |

---

## Rollback Plan

If deployment breaks existing functionality:

```bash
# Go back to previous version
git revert HEAD
npm run build
npm run netlify:deploy
```

Key changes to rollback:
1. Revert `netlify.toml` changes
2. Revert `yocoEnhanced.ts` changes
3. Delete `netlify/functions/yoco/` directory

---

## Timeline

| Time | Action |
|------|--------|
| T-0 | Run `npm run netlify:deploy` |
| T+1 | Netlify starts build |
| T+3 | Build completes |
| T+4 | Deploy starts |
| T+5 | Deploy completes, site live |
| T+10 | Test payment on live site |

---

## Success Criteria

All of these should be true:

1. ‚úÖ `npm run build` completes without errors
2. ‚úÖ `npm run netlify:deploy` succeeds
3. ‚úÖ Site loads at https://nduailms.netlify.app
