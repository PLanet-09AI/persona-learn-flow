# ✅ Yoco Payment Configuration Fix - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## 🎯 Issue Resolution

### Original Error
```
❌ POST https://nduailms.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/yoco 500 (Internal Server Error)
❌ Backend API Error: 500 {error: 'Internal server error', message: 'Payment service not configured - YOCO_SECRET_KEY missing'}
```

### Root Cause
The `YOCO_SECRET_KEY` was hardcoded in `netlify.toml` but wasn't accessible to Netlify Functions.

### ✅ Fixed
Three files updated to securely use environment variables.

---

## 📋 Implementation Summary

### Changed Files

#### 1. netlify.toml
- ✅ **Removed** hardcoded YOCO_SECRET_KEY
- ✅ **Removed** security risk from version control
- ✅ **Now** reads from Netlify environment variables

```diff
[functions.yoco]
- environment = { YOCO_SECRET_KEY = "sk_test_443a9ffcR4ArAmZ7e144502b4b1a" }
```

#### 2. netlify/functions/yoco/index.ts  
- ✅ **Enhanced** environment variable checking
- ✅ **Improved** error logging and diagnostics
- ✅ **Added** multiple fallback sources
- ✅ **Better** error messages for troubleshooting

Key improvements:
```typescript
// Now checks and logs:
- YOCO_SECRET_KEY existence
- YOCO_API_KEY fallback
- Shows what was found/missing
- Better error diagnostics
```

#### 3. .env.example
- ✅ **Added** comprehensive documentation
- ✅ **Included** all environment variables
- ✅ **Added** setup instructions
- ✅ **Added** security reminders

## 🔐 Security Improvements

### Before
- ❌ Secrets hardcoded in netlify.toml
- ❌ Visible in source control
- ❌ Can't be changed without code redeploy
- ❌ Same key across all environments

### After
- ✅ Secrets in Netlify environment
- ✅ Encrypted in Netlify dashboard
- ✅ Can be changed without code changes
- ✅ Different keys per environment (test/prod)
- ✅ Safe to commit to GitHub
