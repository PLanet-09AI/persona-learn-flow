```
User completes quiz → Score saved to Firestore ✅
Click Leaderboard → Shows real user data ✅
Achievements unlock automatically ✅
Rankings update in real-time ✅
```

## Files Changed

| File | Change | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `QuizComponent.tsx` | Added Firestore save | Saves quiz results |
| `QuizComponentNew.tsx` | Added Firestore save | Saves quiz results |
| `Leaderboard.tsx` | Fetch from Firestore | Real leaderboard data |
| `leaderboard.ts` | Complete rewrite | Firestore data fetching |
| `LearningDashboard.tsx` | Add userId prop | Pass auth user ID |

## How Quiz Saving Works

```tsx
// When user completes quiz:
await attemptService.saveAttempt({
  userId: "user123",           // From Firebase Auth
  quizId: "quiz_1729706400",   // Generated or from content
  answers: [0, 1, 2, 1, 0],    // User's selections
  score: 85,                   // Score percentage
  timeTaken: 245,              // Seconds
  completed: true,
  timestamp: new Date()
});
```

**Result**: Attempt saved to Firestore `attempts` collection ✅

## How Leaderboard Loads

```tsx
// When user clicks Leaderboard:
const leaderboard = await getLeaderboardWithUserVisible(
  userProfile,
  userId,     // From Firebase Auth
  maxVisibleItems = 10
);

// Returns: Array of LeaderboardUser with real scores
// [
//   { id: "user1", name: "Alex Chen", score: 2450, level: 5, ... },
//   { id: "user2", name: "Sarah Johnson", score: 2380, level: 4, ... },
//   ...
// ]
```

**Process**:
1. ✅ Fetch all users from Firestore
2. ✅ For each user, fetch their quiz attempts
3. ✅ Sum scores to get total points
4. ✅ Calculate level from points
5. ✅ Calculate streak from attempt dates
6. ✅ Rank users by score
7. ✅ Ensure current user is visible

## Score Calculation

```javascript
// For each user:
totalScore = sum of all quiz scores
level = Math.floor(totalScore / 500) + 1
streak = consecutive days with attempts
```

**Example**:
- Quiz 1: 85%
- Quiz 2: 92%
- Quiz 3: 78%
- **Total**: 255 points
- **Level**: floor(255 / 500) + 1 = **1**

## Testing

### ✅ Test 1: Quiz Saves to Firestore
1. Go to learning page
2. Complete a quiz
3. Check console for: `✅ Quiz attempt saved to Firestore`
4. Check Firestore Dashboard → attempts collection → new document created

### ✅ Test 2: Leaderboard Shows Real Data
1. Click "Leaderboard" tab
2. Should show loading spinner briefly
3. Your score should appear with correct rank
4. Score = your quiz result

### ✅ Test 3: Multiple Quizzes
1. Complete 2-3 more quizzes
2. Check leaderboard
3. Your total score should update
4. Your rank might change based on total

### ✅ Test 4: Achievements Unlock
1. Complete a quiz with 100% → "Perfect Score" unlocks
2. Complete 5 quizzes → "Quiz Master" unlocks
3. Get 500+ total points → "Level Up" unlocks

## Console Logs to Check

```
// During quiz completion:
✅ Quiz attempt saved to Firestore: {...}

// During leaderboard load:
📊 Fetching leaderboard data from Firestore...
✅ Leaderboard loaded: 15 users, top score: 2450

// If error:
❌ Error fetching leaderboard data: ...
```

## Firestore Security Rules

**Recommended** (in Firestore console):

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Attempts: Users can only write their own, anyone can read
    match /attempts/{document=**} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }
    
    // Users: Users can only write their own
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && userId == request.auth.uid;
    }
  }
}
```

## Build Status

```bash
✓ 2122 modules transformed
✓ built in 3.82s
✓ No TypeScript errors
```

## Deployment

To deploy to production:

```bash
npm run netlify:deploy
```

This will:

## FAQ

**Q: Where are the hardcoded users?**
A: Removed completely. All data comes from Firestore.

**Q: How is my score calculated?**
A: Sum of all your quiz percentages (e.g., 85 + 92 + 78 = 255 points).

**Q: Why is my level 1 with 255 points?**
A: Level = floor(score / 500) + 1. You need 500+ points for level 2.

**Q: Can I see other users' scores?**
A: Yes! Leaderboard shows everyone's score, ranked highest first.

**Q: How does streak work?**
A: Counts consecutive days you've taken quizzes, starting from today going backwards.
