# üöÄ CRITICAL FIX - Yoco Payment Function Deployment

## Issue
Payment checkout was returning 404 on deployed site while local testing might work.

## Root Cause
Netlify wasn't recognizing the nested function path `yoco/checkout`. We needed to use the simpler function directory structure.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Yoco Function Files
- `netlify/functions/yoco/index.ts` - Main handler file (NEW)
- `netlify/functions/yoco/checkout.ts` - Kept as backup
- Both files contain the complete payment handler

### 2. Updated Netlify Configuration
```toml
[functions.yoco]
  included_files = ["netlify/functions/**/*"]
  environment = { YOCO_SECRET_KEY = "sk_test_443a9ffcR4ArAmZ7e144502b4b1a" }
```

### 3. Updated Client Endpoint
Changed from: `/.netlify/functions/yoco/checkout`
Changed to: `/.netlify/functions/yoco`

### 4. Added Direct Redirect Rule
```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/.netlify/functions/yoco/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/yoco/:splat"
  status = 200
```

## Files Modified

### Client Side
- `src/services/yocoEnhanced.ts` - Updated endpoint to `/.netlify/functions/yoco`

### Server Side
- `netlify/functions/yoco/index.ts` - ‚ú® NEW FILE with complete handler
- `netlify/functions/yoco/checkout.ts` - Existing backup file

### Configuration
- `netlify.toml` - Updated function name and added redirect

## Enhanced Logging
The Yoco function now includes detailed logging:
```
üîê Yoco checkout function called
‚úÖ API key found: sk_test_...
Calling Yoco API...
‚úÖ Checkout created successfully: [checkout_id]
```

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Commit Changes
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix: Update Yoco function structure for proper Netlify deployment"
```

### Step 2: Deploy
```bash
npm run build
npm run netlify:deploy
```

### Step 3: Monitor
1. Go to nduailms.netlify.app
2. Click Subscribe button
3. Check browser console (F12) for logs
4. Verify payment form appears

## Expected URLs After Deployment
- Function endpoint: `https://nduailms.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/yoco`
- Direct call succeeds with 200 status
- Yoco redirect URL is returned
- User is redirected to Yoco payment form

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Build compiles without errors
- [x] Yoco function files created
- [x] Netlify config updated
- [x] Client endpoint updated
- [x] Enhanced logging added
- [x] Ready for deployment

## Testing After Deployment

### Test Payment Flow
1. Navigate to learning dashboard
2. Click "Subscribe"
3. Verify no 404 error
4. Payment form should appear
5. Complete test transaction (if Yoco sandbox is set up)

### Check Logs
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Click Subscribe again
3. Look for "üîê Yoco checkout function called"
4. Should see "‚úÖ Checkout created successfully"
5. Should see Yoco redirect URL in response

## Troubleshooting if 404 Still Occurs

### Option 1: Check Netlify Function Logs
1. Go to Netlify Dashboard
2. Navigate to site
3. Go to Functions section
4. Check the yoco function logs
5. Look for errors

### Option 2: Force Clear Cache
1. Go to Netlify Dashboard
2. Go to Deploys
3. Click "Trigger deploy"
4. Redeploy last published version

### Option 3: Manual Environment Variable
If Yoco key wasn't picked up:
1. Go to Netlify Dashboard
2. Settings ‚Üí Build & Deploy ‚Üí Environment
3. Add `YOCO_SECRET_KEY=your_actual_key`
4. Trigger redeploy

## Additional Notes

### Why This Fix Works
1. Netlify recognizes `yoco` as a function name
2. `index.ts` is the standard entry point
3. Direct endpoint `/yoco` is simpler than nested paths
4. Enhanced logging helps debug issues

### Future Improvements
- [ ] Move YOCO_SECRET_KEY to Netlify environment variables (don't hardcode)
- [ ] Add request logging to function
- [ ] Add retry logic for Yoco API calls
- [ ] Add rate limiting

### Important
The test key is currently in netlify.toml:
```
YOCO_SECRET_KEY = "sk_test_443a9ffcR4ArAmZ7e144502b4b1a"
```

For production, this should be:
1. Removed from netlify.toml
2. Added as secret in Netlify Dashboard
3. Referenced as environment variable only

## Commands to Deploy

```bash
# Build locally to verify
npm run build

# Deploy to production
npm run netlify:deploy

# Or use Netlify CLI directly
netlify deploy --prod
```

## Expected Success
‚úÖ Payment checkout works without 404
‚úÖ Detailed console logs appear
‚úÖ User redirected to Yoco payment form
‚úÖ Payment processing continues normally

**Action Required**: Run `npm run netlify:deploy` to push these changes to production.
