**Level** = Points / 500 (rounded down) + 1
- 177 points → Level 1
- 500 points → Level 2
- 1000 points → Level 3

**Streak** = Consecutive days with quizzes
- Today's attempt: 1+ day streak
- Today + Yesterday: 2 day streak
- Today + Yesterday + 2 days ago: 3 day streak

**Rank** = Position when sorted by score
- Highest score = Rank #1
- Second highest = Rank #2
