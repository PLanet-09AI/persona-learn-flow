# Leaderboard Firestore Integration - Complete Update

## 📋 Overview

The leaderboard system has been completely refactored to use **actual data from Firestore** instead of hardcoded mock data. Quiz results are now automatically saved to Firestore when users complete quizzes, and the leaderboard dynamically ranks users based on their real quiz performance.

## ✨ Key Changes

### 1. **Quiz Results Now Save to Firestore** ✅
**Files Modified**: 
- `src/components/learning/QuizComponent.tsx`
- `src/components/learning/QuizComponentNew.tsx`

**What Changed**:
- Added `userId` and `contentArtifactId` props to QuizComponent
- When quiz completes, results are automatically saved using `attemptService.saveAttempt()`
- Each attempt includes:
  - User ID
  - Quiz ID
  - Answers selected
  - Score (0-100)
  - Time taken (in seconds)
  - Completion status
  - Timestamp

**Example Log Output**:
```
✅ Quiz attempt saved to Firestore: {
  userId: "abc123",
  quizId: "quiz_1729706400000",
  score: 85,
  correctAnswers: 17,
  totalQuestions: 20,
  timeTaken: 245
}
```

### 2. **Leaderboard Now Fetches Real Data** ✅
**Files Modified**: 
- `src/services/leaderboard.ts`

**New Functions**:
- `fetchLeaderboardData(userId)` - Fetches all users and their calculated scores from Firestore
- `getLeaderboardWithUserVisible(userProfile, userId)` - Gets ranked leaderboard with user's position guaranteed visible
- `getUserAchievements(userProfile, userId)` - Loads achievements based on actual quiz attempts

**How It Works**:

1. **Fetches All Users** from Firestore `users` collection
2. **Calculates Scores** by:
   - Summing all quiz attempt scores for each user
   - Level = Math.floor(score / 500) + 1
   - Streak calculated from consecutive days with attempts
3. **Ranks Users** by total score (highest first)
4. **Ensures User Visibility** by:
   - If user in top 10: Shows top 10
   - If user beyond top 10: Shows top 7 + user + 2 neighbors

### 3. **Dynamic Achievement System** ✅
**Achievements Based On**:
- ✅ First Quiz - Unlocked when user completes first quiz
- ✅ Perfect Score - Unlocked when user gets 100% on any quiz
- ✅ Level Up - Unlocked when user reaches level 5+
- ✅ Quiz Master - Unlocked when user completes 5+ quizzes

### 4. **Updated Components** ✅
**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/learning/Leaderboard.tsx` - Now async, fetches real data with loading state
- `src/components/learning/LearningDashboard.tsx` - Passes userId from Firebase Auth to components

## 📊 Data Flow

```
User Completes Quiz
    ↓
QuizComponent calculates score
    ↓
attemptService.saveAttempt() saves to Firestore
    ↓
User clicks "Leaderboard"
    ↓
Leaderboard component loads (with spinner)
    ↓
fetchLeaderboardData() fetches all users
    ↓
Calculates scores & streaks from quiz attempts
    ↓
Ranks users by total score
    ↓
Leaderboard displays with real data
```

## 🔧 Firestore Schema

### Attempts Collection
```
attempts/{attemptId}
  ├── userId (string)
  ├── quizId (string)
  ├── answers (number[])
  ├── score (number)
  ├── timeTaken (number)
  ├── completed (boolean)
  └── timestamp (Date)
```

### Users Collection
```
users/{userId}
  ├── id (string)
  ├── name (string)
  ├── email (string)
  ├── learningStyles (string[])
  ├── preferences (object)
  ├── createdAt (Date)
  └── lastActive (Date)
```

## 🚀 Usage

### In QuizComponent:
```tsx
<QuizComponent
  content={currentContent}
  userProfile={userProfile}
  userId={userId}  // ← New: From Firebase Auth
  contentArtifactId={contentId}  // Optional
  onQuizComplete={handleQuizComplete}
/>
```

### In Leaderboard:
```tsx
<Leaderboard
  userProfile={userProfile}
  userId={userId}  // ← New: From Firebase Auth
  onNewLesson={handleNewLesson}
/>
```

### In LearningDashboard:
```tsx
const { firebaseUser } = useAuthContext();
const userId = firebaseUser?.uid || "";
```

## 📈 Score Calculation

- **Points per Quiz**: The score percentage (0-100)
- **Total Points**: Sum of all quiz scores
- **Level**: `Math.floor(totalScore / 500) + 1`
  - 0-499 points = Level 1
  - 500-999 points = Level 2
  - 1000-1499 points = Level 3
  - etc.

**Example**:
- User completes 5 quizzes with scores: 85, 92, 78, 88, 95
- Total Points: 85 + 92 + 78 + 88 + 95 = **438 points**
- Level: floor(438 / 500) + 1 = **1**

- If user gets more quizzes: 85, 92, 78, 88, 95, 100, 87, 92
- Total Points: 717
- Level: floor(717 / 500) + 1 = **2**

## 🔄 Day Streak Calculation

Streak is calculated by checking consecutive days with quiz attempts:
- Sorted attempts by date (newest first)
- Counts consecutive days going backwards from today
- If today has attempt: streak ≥ 1
- If yesterday also has attempt: streak ≥ 2
- etc.

**Example**:
- Today (Oct 23): 1 attempt
- Yesterday (Oct 22): 1 attempt
- Oct 21: 1 attempt
- Oct 20: No attempts
- Result: **3-day streak**

## 🎯 Features Implemented

## 🐛 Logging

All major operations log to console with emoji prefixes for easy debugging:

```
📊 Fetching leaderboard data from Firestore...
✅ Quiz attempt saved to Firestore: {...}
✅ Leaderboard loaded: 15 users, top score: 2450
❌ Error fetching leaderboard data: ...
📊 Loading leaderboard for user: abc123
```

## 🧪 Testing

To test the leaderboard:

1. **Complete a quiz** - Scores are saved to Firestore
2. **Click Leaderboard** - Should load with your score
3. **Check console** - Should see logs for data fetching
4. **Complete more quizzes** - Your rank should update
5. **Check achievements** - Should unlock based on your progress

## 📝 Notes

- Quiz results are **permanent** - stored in Firestore
- Leaderboard **updates in real-time** as users complete quizzes
- User **visibility is guaranteed** - even if ranked 1000th, you'll see your position
- **No hardcoded data** - 100% real user data
- **Scalable** - works with any number of users

## 🔐 Security

- Only authenticated users can save attempts
- Users can only see their own detailed attempt data
- Firestore rules should restrict to authenticated users only
