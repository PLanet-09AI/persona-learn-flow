# Quiz Generation Fix and Enhancements

## Problem Fixed
The quiz generation was failing with a 401 Unauthorized error when calling the OpenRouter API directly.

### Root Cause
1. Direct API calls to OpenRouter were failing due to CORS or API key issues
2. No proper error handling or debugging information
3. Quiz prompt wasn't clear enough for AI model to generate proper JSON

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Switched to OpenRouter Service**
- Now uses the `openRouterService` instead of direct fetch calls
- Leverages existing caching, queuing, and retry mechanisms
- Better error handling and fallback models
- Works in both local (Vite) and production (Netlify) environments

### 2. **Enhanced Quiz Prompt Instructions**
Completely rewritten the prompt with:
- **Clear structured sections** for better AI comprehension
- **Explicit format requirements** with examples
- **Critical instructions** for JSON-only output
- **Learning style guidelines** for question adaptation
- **Field context** for subject-specific content
- **Example output** showing exact format needed

### 3. **Better Error Handling**
```typescript
- API key validation before attempting request
- Comprehensive console logging for debugging
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- JSON parsing error handling
- Graceful fallback error reporting
```

### 4. **Improved Debugging**
Enhanced console logging with:
- Color-coded output for easy reading
- Step-by-step progress logging
- Raw and cleaned content display
- Final formatted questions verification

## How Quiz Generation Now Works

### Step 1: Initialize Request
```
User clicks "Generate Quiz"
‚Üì
Validates API key exists
‚Üì
Creates detailed prompt with learning style
```

### Step 2: Generate Questions
```
Sends prompt to OpenRouter Service
‚Üì
Service handles retry/fallback logic
‚Üì
Receives JSON response from AI model
```

### Step 3: Parse & Validate
```
Cleans markdown code fences if present
‚Üì
Parses JSON response
‚Üì
Maps to Question objects
‚Üì
Returns 5 validated questions
```

## Quiz Generation Instructions

The AI now receives these clear instructions:

### For Quiz Maker AI:
1. **Generate exactly 5 questions** from the provided content
2. **Return only valid JSON** - no markdown, no explanations, no preamble
3. **Match the learning style**:
   - Visual: Focus on patterns, diagrams, visual relationships
   - Auditory: Focus on verbal explanations, discussions
   - Reading: Focus on text comprehension and written passages
   - Kinesthetic: Focus on practical applications, real-world examples

4. **Include field context**: Use terminology and examples specific to the subject
5. **Structure each question**:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "1",
     "question": "Clear, specific question text",
     "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
     "correctAnswer": 0,  // Index of correct option (0-3)
     "explanation": "Detailed explanation of why this is correct"
   }
   ```

6. **Quality standards**:
   - Variety in difficulty levels
   - Mix of question types
   - Clear, unambiguous questions
   - Comprehensive explanations

## Testing the Quiz Feature

1. **Create learning content** with a specific topic and field
2. **Click "Generate Quiz"** button
3. **Select your learning style** (Visual, Auditory, Reading, Kinesthetic)
4. **Quiz should generate within seconds** with 5 questions
5. **Check browser console** (F12) for detailed generation logs

## Console Debugging

When generating a quiz, you'll see colored console output:
```
üìù AI Quiz Generation
üìú Raw Content: [response from AI]
üß© Cleaned Content: [after removing markdown]
üß© Parsed Questions: [parsed JSON]
‚úÖ Final Questions: [formatted questions]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "API key not configured"
**Fix**: Make sure `VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is set in `.env.development`

### Error: "Failed to parse AI response"
**Possible causes**:
1. AI returned markdown with code fences
2. AI returned invalid JSON format
3. Missing required fields in response

**Fix**: Check console for "Content that failed to parse" - shows exact response

### Quiz generation is slow
**Possible causes**:
1. Request queued behind other requests
2. OpenRouter API rate limiting
3. Network latency

**Expected wait time**: 2-10 seconds depending on server load

### 401 Unauthorized Error
**Causes**: 
1. Invalid API key
2. Expired API key
3. API key format incorrect

**Fix**:
1. Verify API key in environment variables
2. Check key isn't expired on OpenRouter dashboard
3. Restart dev server after env changes

## Configuration

### Environment Variables Needed
```
VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_SITE_URL=http://localhost:5173
VITE_SITE_NAME=Ndu AI Learning System
```

### Learning Style Settings
The system automatically adapts questions based on:
- **visual**: Visual relationships, diagrams, patterns
- **auditory**: Verbal explanations, discussions
- **reading**: Text comprehension, written content
- **kinesthetic**: Practical applications, hands-on examples
